In this section we present a different approach to FVV.
Instead of performing 3D reconstruction, image-based methods generate directly the image of the novel viewpoint.
When multiple cameras are present, plane sweeping can be used [05:Yang et al., 2004] for both small and wide 
baseline setups.
Plane sweeping has already been used for novel view point in soccer scenes. Goorts et al. [05:Goorts
et al., 2012a; Goorts et al., 2013a] present a method
with two plane sweeps and a depth filtering step suitable for smaller baseline 
setups of about 1 meter. 
Moreover, this method has some problems like disappearing players
if they overlap in the image.
