\section{Overview}
In the field of computer vision, the techniques for syn-
thesizing virtual view images from a number of real camera
images have been studied since the 1990s \cite{b1,b2,b3}.

Free-viewpoint video in sports TV broadcast production is a challenging problem involving the conflicting requirements of 
broadcast picture quality with video-rate generation.
FVV techniques for generating novel viewpoints using a multiview camera setup can be catogorized into two classes: 
3D reconstruction and image-based rendering. Using 3D reconstruction, it is possible to construct 3D models of objects to
generate the desired view from an arbitrary viewpoint. The quality of the virtual view image generated
by these methods depends on the accuracy of the 3D model. In order to produce an accurate model, a
large number of video cameras surrounding the object are used. Moreover, ... TODO:01
% Furthermore,
% camera calibration [13] is usually required to relate 2-D co-
% ordinates in images to their corresponding 3-D coordinates in
% object space. As it is essential to measure the 3-D positions of
% several points in the object space, calibration becomes difficult
% especially in a large space. For these reasons, the object area is
% generally limited to a few cubic meters in this approach.

It is not practical to apply these methods to a scene that
contains multiple objects with complicated movements such as
a sporting match. TODO

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
